# Analysis-of-Cyber-Attacks
The focus of my project will be to conduct a comprehensive analysis of cyber security attack data sourced from various regions. The aim of the project will be to identify prevalent cyber threats, understand their patterns, and explore the potential vulnerabilities contributing to successful intrusions. My research questions primarily revolve around deciphering the characteristics of different cyber-attacks, discerning the targeted sectors, and outlining the geographical hotspots of these activities. Additionally, I will try to uncover any underlying trends or associations between the attack vectors and their corresponding impact levels.
I intend to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any initial patterns or anomalies within the dataset. This can be done by  conducting Clustering kmeans to group similar cyber attacks based on their attributes and behavior. Subsequently, we plan to implement Decision Tree algorithms to create a model to classify cyber threats and assess their potential impact levels.
These methods are good at handling the complexity and scale of the cyber security attack data. Clustering algorithms will help categorize the attacks into distinct groups, facilitating the identification of commonalities and differences among them. The Decision Tree algorithm will provide a transparent and interpretable model for understanding the different types of cyber threats and their potential impact, aiding in proactive threat management and mitigation strategies.
